Before running this method, all missing values in your data should be converted as the form of 'NaN'.  \r\n\r\nThis method is time consuming, please allow adequate time for running.  \r\n\r\nFolders attachment, bi-BPCA and BPCA should be added into current working directory.\r\n# Usage\r\n[matrix_imputed] = f_bicluster_BPCA ([matrix_missing], [number of iterations])\r\n# Example\r\nM_imputed = f_bicluster_BPCA(M_missing, 1);\r\n# Citation\r\nF.
